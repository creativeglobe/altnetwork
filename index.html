			<h1 style="font-size: 5em; margin: 0 0 0.3em; line-height: 1.1;">An alternative social networking platform, designed by its users</h1>
			<p style="font-size: 2em; margin: 0; opacity: 0.9; line-height: 1.4;">
				Today's social media platforms have become increasingly restrictive.
Algorithms, arbitrary rules, content moderation practices, and the extensive use of personal data have distanced many people from what social networking was originally meant to be: free expression and meaningful communication.

Our idea is simple:
to create a social networking platform open to different viewpoints, without political or thematic bias, and with genuine respect for the user.

We are not aiming to replace everything.
We aim to build a real alternative, shaped by the participation of its community.

How the project will start

At this stage, we are not asking for money.
First, we want to see whether there is real interest.

For practical reasons, during the initial phase, the platform will be available only in countries where active interest and participation are demonstrated.
This allows us to launch in a more structured way, with real users rather than artificial or unfocused exposure.

If a sufficient number of interested people come forward:

• the creation of the platform will be officially announced
• optional financial support will then be opened
• those who expressed interest early will have a voice in shaping the project

The platform will move forward only if there is a community that truly wants it.

Call to action

If you believe there is a need for such an alternative,
sign up to express your interest and be among the first to receive updates.

No commitment. No payment. Just a declaration of interest.
