			<p>An alternative social networking platform,<br />

			<p>
				Today's social media platforms have become increasingly restrictive.<br><br>
				Algorithms, arbitrary rules, content moderation practices, and the extensive use of personal data have distanced many people from what social networking was originally meant to be: free expression and meaningful communication.<br><br>
				Our idea is simple:<br>
				to create a social networking platform open to different viewpoints, without political or thematic bias, and with genuine respect for the user.<br><br>
				We are not aiming to replace everything.<br>
				We aim to build a real alternative, shaped by the participation of its community.<br><br>
				How the project will start<br>
				At this stage, we are not asking for money.<br>
				First, we want to see whether there is real interest.<br>
				For practical reasons, during the initial phase, the platform will be available only in countries where active interest and participation are demonstrated.<br>
				This allows us to launch in a more structured way, with real users rather than artificial or unfocused exposure.<br><br>
				If a sufficient number of interested people come forward:<br>
				• the creation of the platform will be officially announced<br>
				• optional financial support will then be opened<br>
				• those who expressed interest early will have a voice in shaping the project<br><br>
				The platform will move forward only if there is a community that truly wants it.<br><br>
				Call to action<br>
				If you believe there is a need for such an alternative,<br>
				sign up to express your interest and be among the first to receive updates.<br><br>
				No commitment. No payment. Just a declaration of interest.
